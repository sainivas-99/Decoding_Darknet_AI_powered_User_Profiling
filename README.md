# ML for Predictive Analytics and Behavior Profiling in Darknet Forums

 The project focuses on improving cybersecurity by utilizing advanced data analytics and machine learning techniques to analyze and predict activities within darknet hacking forums. The project's objective is to provide cybersecurity professionals with critical insights by identifying anomalies and forecasting trends, thereby enabling proactive detection and mitigation of potential threats.

The approach involves gathering data from various darknet forums through web scraping, followed by comprehensive preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA). The project employs sophisticated machine learning models, including Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks, BERT, and Variational Autoencoders (VAE), to model user activity, detect temporal anomalies, and predict unusual behavior patterns. These techniques help uncover vendor behaviors, sentiment trends, and potential risks, addressing the complex and unpredictable nature of forum dynamics.
